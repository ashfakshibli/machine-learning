#### Features:
    - Feature vector
    - Feature space - 3D
    - Scatter Plot 2D
#### Cartesian coordinate system 
    - Rotation
    - Translation
    - Scaling
#### Vectors:
    – coordinates, vector length, unit vector, zero vector, position vector, free vector
    – dot product
    – Linear independence 
#### Matrix
##### Rank of a Matrix
    - Rank r: number of linear independent rows/columns
    - 3*2 matrix has rank of 2.(By making 3 2D vectors expanded)
    - If a row is derivable(multiply, add ...) from other then it will not be in the rank.
#### Vector- Vector product
    - Inner product <x,y> = R number
    - Outer product 
    - Rank 1 matrix [1 1 .... 1] = x1^T
#### Matrix - Vector product
    - y^T = x^TA
#### Matrix- Matrix Product
